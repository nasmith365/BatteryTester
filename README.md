# BatteryTester

Final Embedded Systems lab project that was done in a group of three including myself, Sean Robb, and Seth Ware. This program was written in C in AVR Studio using an AVR 32A microcontroller, two sliders, LCD screen, buttons and some other parts. We did all the programming, designing and building the circuit.
