# BatteryTester

 Battery tester that takes gets values from the battery (voltage, current) uses those values along with others (Time,mAh) and displays them on an LCD for the user to use. Stores previous values in EEPROM so they can be compared to previous results.

Project that was done in a group of three including myself. This program was written in C in AVR Studio using an AVR 32A microcontroller, two sliders, LCD screen, buttons and some other parts. We did all the programming, designing and building the circuit.
